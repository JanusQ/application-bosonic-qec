## Bosonic QEC
Bosonic QEC have been experimental demonstrated, as [reference/](reference/41586_2025_8642_MOESM1_ESM.pdf), but the application build on it is unexplored.
## To do
1. Implement the bosonic-qubit QEC in the reference paper
In this code, bit-flip errors are suppressed with a bosonic cat code and residual phase-flip errors are corrected with a repetition code.
2. Simulate the performance of this concatenated codes using noisy simulation
3. Try to run a small QFT circuit on this codes.
